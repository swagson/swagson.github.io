				The Seattle Seahawks are a professional American football franchise in the National Football League (NFL) based in Seattle, Washington. They are members of the NFC West division of the National Football Conference (NFC). The Seahawks joined the NFL in 1976 as an expansion team along with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Seahawks are owned by Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, and are currently coached by Pete Carroll. Since 2002 the Seahawks have played their home games at CenturyLink Field near downtown Seattle after previously playing home games in the Kingdome 19 and Husky Stadium.

				The Seahawks are the only NFL franchise located in the Pacific Northwest region of North America and thus attract support from a wide geographical area, including Oregon, Montana, Idaho, and Alaska, as well as Canadian fans in British Columbia and Alberta.

				Seahawks fans are known collectively as the "12th Man"or "12th Fan". The Seahawks' fans have twice set, and currently hold, the Guinness World Record for the loudest crowd noise at a sporting event. On December 2, 2013, during a Monday Night Football game against the New Orleans Saints at CenturyLink Field, the Seahawks' crowd was measured at 137.6 dBs. This record reclaimed the title, previously set at 136.6 dBs earlier in the 2013 season against the San Francisco 49ers.

				Over the years the Seahawks have had some notable players on the team, such as Steve Largent, Dave Brown, Jim Zorn, Dave Krieg, John Randle, Kenny Easley, Curt Warner, Joe Nash, Brian Blades, Cortez Kennedy, Joey Galloway, Warren Moon, Walter Jones, Jerry Rice, Shaun Alexander, Matt Hasselbeck, Marcus Trufant, Marshawn Lynch, Percy Harvin, Earl Thomas, Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor, Brandon Browner and Russell Wilson. Largent, Kennedy, and Moon have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, with Jones' 2014 induction having been announced. Easley, Jones, Kennedy, Krieg, Largent, Warner, and Zorn have been inducted into the Seahawks Ring of Honor, along with cornerback Dave Brown and defensive end Jacob Green.

				The Seahawks have won eight division titles and two conference championships. They are the only team to have played in both the AFC and NFC Championship Games. They have appeared in two Super Bowls, most recently Super Bowl XLVIII where they defeated the Denver Broncos 43-8 to win their first title.
